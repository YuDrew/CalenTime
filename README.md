# CalenTime
 Timetracking using the Google Calendar API and Firebase.
## Current Functionality
* Not much, just some basic formatting
* Connected app to Firebase, though it's not used yet.
## To-Dos
* Break up components into separate files for readability
* Set up Google Login Authorizations
* Connect to Google Calendar API to populate event information (titles, start times, and end times)
* Set up Firebase Realtime Database to track time elapsed
* Create detail views to track performance on each event (comparing planned activity to true activity)
* Create a tab that compiles overall performance by day, week, and month
