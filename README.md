# CalenTime
 Timetracking using the Google Calendar API and Firebase.
## Current Functionality
* Basic formatting.
* Connected app to Firebase, though it's not used yet.
* Time elapsed is tracked and updates per second, though it doesn't save to Firebase yet
* You can navigate between pages ðŸŽ‰
## To-Dos
* Break up components into separate files for readability
* Set up Google Sign In and OAuth
* Connect to Google Calendar API to populate event information (titles, start times, and end times)
* Set up Firebase Realtime Database to track time elapsed
* Create detail views to display performance on each event (comparing planned activity to true activity)
* Create a tab that displays overall performance by day, week, and month
